Explanation of the Decision Boxes and Transitions:
Initial State:

[State 1: Empty/No Traffic]
This is the starting point where the traffic light is green, and no vehicles are on the road. The first cars enter the road, triggering the transition to State 2.
[State 2: Light Traffic]:

If traffic is increasing (i.e., more cars are entering), the system will transition to State 3: Moderate Traffic.
If no more cars are entering, the system remains in State 2.
Decision Box 1: Is Traffic Increasing?

If yes, we move to State 3: Moderate Traffic.
If no, we stay in State 2: Light Traffic (traffic remains light).
[State 3: Moderate Traffic]:

If traffic is congested (i.e., more vehicles are on the road), the system transitions to State 4: Congestion.
If not, the system transitions to State 2 or remains at State 3 depending on the flow of traffic.
Decision Box 2: Is Traffic Congested?

If yes, the system moves to State 4: Congestion.
If no, the system remains in State 3: Moderate Traffic.
[State 4: Congestion]:

If traffic is clearing (i.e., fewer cars), the system will transition back to State 3: Moderate Traffic or State 2: Light Traffic, depending on how much congestion is cleared.
Decision Box 3: Is Traffic Clearing?

If yes, the system moves to State 3: Moderate Traffic or State 2: Light Traffic.
If no, the system stays in State 4: Congestion.
[Final State]:

Once the traffic clears, the system returns to State 1: Empty/No Traffic, completing the cycle.
Color Legend (for visual reference):
Green: Representing light traffic or no vehicles.
Yellow: Representing moderate traffic.
Red: Representing congestion.
Blue: For decision boxes.
Final Notes:
Decision Boxes: These represent critical decision-making points in the system, like checking if traffic is increasing or if congestion is happening. The transitions are based on the answer ("Yes" or "No") from each decision box.
Events: The transitions are triggered by events like "Increase in cars," "Vehicles leave the road," or "Traffic clears."
State Transitions: The system is dynamic, changing states based on real-time traffic and pedestrian conditions.
With these updates, the state diagram includes the decision-making process along with events, transitions, and colors to clearly depict the traffic flow. You can now visualize the diagram more effectively or recreate it in a diagramming tool.
